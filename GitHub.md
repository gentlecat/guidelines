# Using GitHub

## The workflow

We follow the "typical" GitHub workflow when contributing changes:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) a repository into your account.
2. Create a new branch and give it a meaningful name. For example, if you are going to fix issue MBS-4635, branch can be
   called `mbs-4635` or `replace-image`.
3. Make your changes and commit them with a [good description](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). *You don't need to provide a lot
   of details, but make sure that people who look at the commit history afterwards can understand what you were changing
   and why.*
4. [Create](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) a new pull request on GitHub. Make sure that
   title of your pull request is descriptive. If you are fixing an issue that exists in our bug tracker reference it
   like this: `MBS-4635: Allow replacing images`. **Not** `[MBS-4635] - Allow replacing images` or `Allow replacing images
   (MBS-4635)` or `MBS-4635`.
